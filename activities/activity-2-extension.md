# Extension 🔥

- Using flexbox make your cards sit side by side, in the middle of the page

- Create a button for each card. A red warning/danger button for Darth Vader and an opposing button for Yoda

- Add a couple more cards with the same base styles (and buttons) of The Dark Side and The Force cards but with different colours and images. Get as creative as you like! Remember to reuse styles and follow BEM naming.

- Have a go at applying [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) to your project

If you've got this far then the BEM/OOCSS force is with you, Skywalker! Great job! 🙏 ✨ 🧘‍♀️
